# r/cscareerquestionseu survey2021
Repo associated with r/cascareerquestionseu's survey 2021

The notebook contains a limited analysis based on the responses to the CSCQ:EU survey of 2021. It is aimed as a supplement to the google-docs provided pie charts.
    
I have tried to keep it relatively shallow but still interesting, and apart from a couple of bar charts I've included some word counts.

Feel free to fork this and post your own visualizations. I have not gone in depth as I also like keeping it a little bit "rough" to see what everyone can do with the same data. Please note that the data set included in this repo does not include a small number of columns - some because the results were very personal (mentions of suicidal thoughts in how covid has affected your career were surprisingly common) and others because we'd like to keep them as feedback on our way of moderating the sub and providing interesting recurrent posts.

Feel free to shoot us a mod mail on [r/cscareerquestionseu](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/) if you have any questions!
